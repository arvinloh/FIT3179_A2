  <strong>Peak Live Births</strong>
  <li>The majority of live births occur at gestational ages 39 weeks (98,495 live births, 31.4%) and 38 weeks (73,523 live births, 23.5%).</li>
  <li>These two gestational ages together account for over half of all live births. </li>

  <strong>Fetal Deaths</strong>
  <li>The highest number of fetal deaths occurs at very early gestational ages, particularly at 20 weeks (336 fetal deaths, 14.9%) and 21 weeks (341 fetal deaths, 15.1%).</li>
  <li>Fetal deaths significantly decrease as gestational age increases, with very few fetal deaths occurring at 39 and 40 weeks (44 fetal deaths each, 1.9%).</li>

  <strong>Gestational Age 39 Weeks</strong>
  <li>Gestational age 39 weeks has the highest percentage of live births (31.4%) and a very low percentage of fetal deaths (1.9%).</li>
  <li>This indicates that gestational age 39 weeks is the safest gestational age for live births.</li>

  <li>The majority of live births have a birth weight between 3,000 and 3,499 grams (37.42%).</li>
  <li>Very few live births have a birth weight below 2,500 grams (6.81%) or above 4,500 grams (1.2%).</li>
